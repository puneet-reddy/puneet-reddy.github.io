(May 2017 - Present)",text:["CSS Corp started out as a customer support and call center operation. \n            In recent years (2015 onwards) they have branched out into the digital\n            and analytics space and by the time I joined them in 2017 they had \n            already laid the groundwork required for a division specializing in \n            effective AI/ML solution development.","Joining such a new department certainly had it's advantages, as I was \n            able to jump right into the exciting work of designing and implementing\n            a chat-bot. The basic skeleton for this had already been ideated by\n            my colleagues Prashath and Nishanth and when I joined they were in the\n            midst of figuring out the techinical aspects of the implementation as\n            well as the best architecture for the computer science side of things. \n            Given such an opportunity, I dived right into the world of NLP and \n            linguistics and four months and several thousand lines of code later, \n            we had a working bot.","Once a prototype of the bot was ready and the sales & marketing guys\n            where in a position to use it for client demos there wasn't a whole lot\n            to be done till we found a client who was interested enough in it and willing\n            to sponsor further development. However, my ability to internalise complex\n            systems and to make the best decisions when choosing between architectural\n            paths had already been noticed. All this while, the department had\n            focused solely on building a team good at machine learning. My work on the\n            bot was a realization. Good software engineering and design could speed \n            things up! I was in demand!","For the next few months, I was hopping between projects and clients. \n            Never really part of one team, but simultaneously consulting with \n            nearly every team in the fledgling department. I worked on everything.\n            From helping find C libraries to speed up OCR written in python, to\n            setting up Spark clusters to fine tuning regex code to helping migrate\n            from SQL to NoSQL, to model evaluation and hyper-parameter tuning; \n            EVERYTHING. It was an exciting time for sure, but all good things must\n            eventually come to an end.","There was a new client on the engineering side of the business who \n            wanted a web portal developed and all their existing code as well as \n            their own expertise was in python based development. This was not a \n            skill that CSS Corp. had in ready supply. Most of their existing team\n            was only trained in Java and PHP. Looking around the organization, they\n            found that I had the requried expertise in Flask & Django and web \n            development in general. I was promptly conscripted for the job.","This unexpectedly turned out to be quite a challenge."]},{ID:"2",logo_url:"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5cf9058299b2c44049b064b4/5cf907c58e7d8a6315dfeb86_3LOQ.png",link_to:"https://www.3loq.com/",title:"3LOQ (Nov 2014 - Apr 2017)",text:["\n            Coming soon!.\n            ","\n            Watch this space.\n            ","\n            There will be an interesting story here soon™.\n            "]},{ID:"3",logo_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/New_Bloomberg_Logo.svg/330px-New_Bloomberg_Logo.svg.png",link_to:"https://www.bloomberg.com/",title:"Bloomberg LLP (Feb 2013 - Jul 2014)",text:["\n            Coming soon!.\n            ","\n            Watch this space.\n            ","\n            There will be an interesting story here soon™.\n            "]}]}}},s=i,r=n("2877"),l=Object(r["a"])(s,o,a,!1,null,null,null);t["default"]=l.exports}}]);
